ok so let's decide about how to improve the game ui
# Menu screen:
- Use a font that's not Impact
- Make the text not just "TTD6" and have some like stuff springing out of it
- Make the description not italic and generally look better
- Start button's color doesn't match color theme, change it to a brick texture or similar
- Take the "how to play" and put it inside a menu
	- Probs gonna be a dropdown with a nice transition
- Add button sound effects
- Add button hover effects
- Better background image
- Obviously we will keep the flashing gdc ad

# Game:
- Make the game actually take up the entire screen
- Add indicators for the weapon capacity that appear when you hover
- GUI effects similar to Zombiewars for wave end
- Put everything into its proper place:
	- Inventory sort of thing for the tower selection
	- Healthbar sort of thing for the lives counter that changes color
	- Fancy wave counter at the top

and lastly also a consistent color theme with everything
